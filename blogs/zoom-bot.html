			<h2>Back Story:</h2>So, my father recived a call from my college they said that I don't attend my online
			lectures and I have really low attendance and my father got really angry and scholded me really hard, but I
			was busy learning Web Development. So, I have to do something about it, about my attendance. So. I got an
			idea to create a Python Bot which will take my classes when I am not so that my attendance are maintained
			and I can concentrate on working my web development skills.<br><br>
			<h2>Requirements:</h2>So, the first requirement is to get the meeting id and it's password. Now second thing
			is to look for the schedule and check it if any class is present or not if yes get the time and open the
			zoom app on time and then to click on join button and enter the meeting url then click the check boxe to
			disable my video or I can also set this setting to default and click on join to successfully join the
			meeting, else sleep.<br><br>
			<h2>Main Process:</h2>So I will first create a new directory and initialze a git repo and then start by
			creating a virtual environment. Now I will break the whole problem, so I need to the following things:
			<ol>
				<li>Open the timetable.json file to check for the class timmings</li>
				<li>Check for the class according to today's day and time</li>
				<li>Open Zoom App</li>
				<li>Click the button</li>
				<li>Enter the link and again click the button</li>
			</ol><br>
			So, I will start with the easiest thing first open the Zoom app. So, for that I will use the subprocess
			module and give the path of the zoom app as raw string and this will open the app. Now moving to the
			timetable part, I will use json for this purpose the idea is to create a json file with the week days name
			as keys and the array of the class time as the value. Now I will create a function to read all the data from
			the timetable.json file and return it. Now I will create a checkClass function to check for the class time
			according to today's day and current time. So, first of all I got today's day and current time using the
			datetime module and then get the schedule of the matching day into a variable and then inside an infinite
			while loop it will match current time with the schedule and if it matches, then call the openZoom function
			and wait till the class gets over. Now it's time to test the program so for this I will set the time as 2
			min after the current time and run all the file and wait. So, the program is running correctly it worked as
			desired. Now I need to write a function to join the class so fir that the bot has to click on some of the
			buttons and also enter some text so I need to figure out some way so that the bot can identify the buttons
			and perform some gui actions. So, after Googling for some time I got the solution and it is a python module
			which is capable of doing all of these and the module is pyautogui. So, I will start by pip installing the
			module and then continue. So, this module supports finding things by sample image on the screen so I will
			take advantage of this thing and take the screenshot of those buttons which I want my bot to click on and
			then give that to the module's locateCenterOnScreen function and store that to a variable and then use
			another function moveto to move the cursor on that button and then call the click function to perform a left
			click on it and perform the same thing to the other buttons too. So, now I am thinking as it is the repeated
			thing so why not create another function to perform that and just pass the image file to that function and
			call it whenever I need. Now I need those images so I will start zoom and use a utility available in Windows
			10 called snip and sketch to snip those buttons and save them to the images folder in the same directory and
			then pass the path to the function call. So, now I have snaped those buttons and now it's time to check if
			the function is working or not so I have passed the main screen join button image to the function. So, the
			test was successful now I can continue writting further. So, I am done writting the whole process for
			joining a meeting and also tested it and it's working correctly. Now it's time to go further and pass it the
			meeting ID and it's password so I have created another file link.py and declared two variables there and
			imported that in the main file and passed that where ever needed I have also written a function to write the
			text to the fields and then hit the enter button, So. everything is done now it's time to check the program
			against real meeting so I created a meeting from my another zoom account and then added meeting ID and
			password to the link.py file and now I will test the joinClass function. So, the test is successful and my
			bot is joining the meeting and working correctly without any errors so now I will push the code. So, today I
			had 4 lectures and the Bot performed really awesome and it took all the lectures joined every meeting on
			time without any error so it's time to show this to my bois and gals they will be surprised and will also
			ask for it.</p>
