				<p><h2>Back Story:</h2>I always wanted to have a portfolio. After many unsuccessfull attempts like downloading the entire portfolio of a persion using HTTRACK, using my basic HTML CSS knowledge and finally using Tailwindcss and I created a very nice looking portfolio but I didn't knew how to make it functional, so, I dropped the idea. Then I came to know about Full Stack Web Developer and I found it really awesome and decided that I want to be this. And I started my research on it and came to finall decision that I should learn MERN Stack and some other basic concepts. Then I began to search for the resources for the that and I came to know about an awesome person 'Tanay Pratap' he works at Microsoft and the awesome thing is that he is an organiser of a Camp named 'Neogcamp' where he mentors and teaches students how to be a Full Stack Developer. So, I joined his camp.<br><br><h2>Making Component Library:</h2>So, the idea was very simple but super effect, the idea was to create your own component library so that the later process becomes too easy and less time taking. So, the very first thing I did was I went to Google Fonts and looked for some of the fonts to use on the site and after spending lots of time I finally figured it out and now I had a collection of some awesome looking fonts. Now after this I started writing my code part wise as Tanay Sir taught to break the problem into the smaller chunks and then solve it. I wrote HTML code for the particular chunk and then wrote the CSS code for styling it. Now I need to make a navigation bar which actually sounds very simple but it isn't. So, the problem was it wass easy to create a nav bar in two lines but I wanted to make it single line and that too responsive. So, I decided that let's keep this responsive thing aside and focus on the one line nav bar. It took me long to figure it out and create the desired nav bar but it was really fun I learned alot doing that. So now I created the header section and my idea was to put my own picture instead of some illustration. It was really easy to create the header section. Then I created some different types of sections it was easy too. Then again came tough part but really challenging and intersting the footer. So, before moving forward I decided a basic design for the footer section. But this time it was easy to make it as I have already made nav bar so I used the same concept here too. Now here comes the best and most difficult part I had to decide some colour scheme for the site. So, after spending few hours browsing the internet and trying some of the colour palette generating websites I finally got what I wanted. Now it was the time to bring my portfolio to life so after doing some colouring it was looking really preety. Now I had to make the site responsive so I Googled it and fond an article about media queries and using them I made my portfolio resposive.<br><br><h2> Making the Portfolio:</h2>So, this was the time I felt really good and free this was relly easy I had to do copy pasting from my library and change the content and links and done. I did the same thing to the others pages of the site. And finally my portfolio is up and running and also responsive.<br><br>I really liked Tanay Sirs approch it made my work supper easy and interesting. There are many YouTubers teaching to make websites but know one told this approch. You are awesome Tanay Sir. Thanks to you and Neogcamp. Somethig good happend in 2020.</p><br> <a href="https://github.com/DeeshanSharma/Portfolio" class="link secondary-link" target="_blank">Portfolio Source Code</a></p>
